//Caitlyn's Crafty Creations computes a retail price for each product as the cost of materials 
//plus $14 multiplied by the number of hours of work required to create the product, 
//plus $6 shipping and handling. Caitlynâ€™s Crafty Creations is having a semi-annual sale now, 
//and everything is 25% off before shipping and handling:
//Retail price = 0.75 * (cost of materials + (14 * hours of work)) + 6
